            <h2>Why Altschool Africa?</h2>
            <p>I have given some deep thoughts to taking up a career in the tech industry for some years now. I have actually taken up courses in the business side of tech and found it very interesting.</p>
            <p>When I decided to learn more about software Engineering, my search for a platform with a well structured curriculum led me to Altschool, and so far I think I made the best decision.</p>

            <h2>A short Biography</h2>
            <p>My name is Osazuwa Obadigie, I am a graduate of Biochemistry and I hold a masters of business AdministrIation in general management.  </p>
            <p>I have many years of working experience across variouse industries both in the operational and project management field.</p>
            <p>I started my career as a management trainee in Frigoglass Industries Nig Ltd. I grew through the ranks to become a production coordinator overseeing the entire operations in the factory. I thereafter left the organisation to set up my small business of Ice block commercial production and event logistics supply. I have ran the business successfully for some years now and along the way I have acquired additional skills in IT project management and business analysis. As a life long learner I found my way to altschool Africal to learn and satisfy my dream of becoming a software Enginner. I hope I am able to stay the course and pick my career as a software Engineer and make a glorious success of it./p>
